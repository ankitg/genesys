#Genesys Hackathon.
----------

## Overview

This repo houses code written by Ankit and Sinthushan during the 24 hour Genesys Hackathon, held at Ryerson Intenational Living Centre on the 18th and 19th of July 2014.

## Objective

The code here provides for an iOS and an Android library solution to enable anyone making an iOS or Android app to add Genesys chat functionality to their application.

## USAGE

### Android

The android solution presents itself as a jar and provides views (activities) for login and the actual chat window. The library is completely skinable and has no dependencies (apart from appcompat for backward compatibility). It uses a speech bubble styling from <https://github.com/AdilSoomro/Android-Speech-Bubble>

### iOS

The iOS solution presents itself in form of a CocoaPod. You can find it here: <https://github.com/sin2/SAGenesysChat>
